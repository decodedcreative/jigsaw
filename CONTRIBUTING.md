# Contributing to Jigsaw

## Incremental rollout workflow

WIP design-system work is preserved on `wip/design-system-overhaul-backup` (commit `0e6c17a`, 373 files). This branch is the **source of truth** for cherry-picking into JSW tickets — do not merge it directly into `main`.

Each JSW ticket produces a focused PR that brings one slice of that WIP back onto `main` in a clean, reviewed state.

### Starting a new JSW ticket

```bash
# 1. Branch from the latest main
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/jsw-XX-short-description

# 2. Reference (or cherry-pick files from) the backup branch
git checkout wip/design-system-overhaul-backup -- path/to/relevant/files

# 3. Clean up, adapt, test, commit
# 4. Open a PR targeting main
```

> Tip: you don't have to take files verbatim from the backup. Use it as a reference
> and re-implement cleanly where the original was rough.

### Branch naming

`feat/jsw-XX-short-description` — matches the Jira ticket key.
